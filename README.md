# vote-with-your-dollars-poll
LPTexas ran a successful Vote With Your Dollars candidate debate invitation poll. We're sharing how we accomplished this poll in our NationBuilder site. Code can be adapted for use in other CRM systems.

Pleasere read the LICENSE for proper use and attribution.

## NationBuilder Configuration
Create a landing page for your Vote With Your Dollars poll, and included the contents of `vwyd.html` in the `Custom Template`. You will need to edit the map of candidates, candidate images, and individual candidate donation pages.

Create an indivudual donation page for each option in your poll, and under `Donation Settings` check `Set goal for donations`, and select `Amount raised` for the goal. Set the goal to an arbitrarily high number, this can be raised if the individual donations get too close, or perhaps the donations can exceed the goal and the total will continue to update beyond that.
